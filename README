I think this is official enough, I dunno.

Things that need doing by Wednesday April 9th:
Simulation doesn't start immediatly. Don't start time running 
immediatly DONE
Ability to restart simulation. DONE
Better controls. DONE I THINK
Better text explanations DONE
Structure the right justified information better DONE I THINK
Fix UI in constant size. DONE I THINK. Super HD displays or retina whatever might still make that look tiny but testing it on my laptop and large PC monitor it looks okay.
Provide better frame DONE
More space between sliders and text. See above, still playing with css to make this work right.
Signify range of values on sliders. DONE Explained in the sidebar.
Direct explanation of what sliders do and what checkboxes do. DONE
Eliminate score, simulation ends when ball is out and restarts
when ball is put back in play. DONE
