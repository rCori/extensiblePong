I think this is official enough, I dunno.

Things that need doing by Wednesday April 9th:
Simulation doesn't start immediatly. Don't start time running 
immediatly DONE
Ability to restart simulation. DONE
Better controls. DONE I THINK
Better text explanations
Structure the right justified information better
Fix UI in constant size.
Provide better frame DONE
More space between sliders and text.
Signify range of values on sliders
Direct explanation of what sliders do and what checkboxes do.
Eliminate score, simulation ends when ball is out and restarts
when ball is put back in play. DONE
